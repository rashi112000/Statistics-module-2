print("hello world!") # this command is going to display something on our screen 
# print here is a function- it carries out some task 
# need ("") this for print to read the command
# ctrl+ enter is used to run the code or that specific line, select the whole command if it is more than a line
">" this greater than symbol is called prompt
# the command displayed on screen is also withtin double quotes
2 + 5 # here " + " is also a fucntion 
# " - " for subtraction 
# " * " for multiplication
# " / " for division
# " ** " or " ^ " for exponentiation
# for integer division, the symbol is " % / % " [5/3= 1.333 so, 5 %/% = 1], it removes the decimal part that's it
# for modulo- the symbol is " %% ", meaning the number which we were not able to divide, the remainder type [5 %% 3= 2]
# ctrl + shift + C helps to comment multiple lines as a comment- we select them all and then use "ctrl+shift+C"
# "ctrl + shift + Z" is to redo the command while "ctrl + Z" is to undo the command 
# how to make a variable 
# variable name <- "value we want to store" 
# "<-" an operator - it is called assignment operator
# can check the variables we created in the environment tab
# to seperate 2 words we use underscore, full stop (.) or abcDef (seperating them with capital alphabet) , eg: my_name <- rashi [or my.name or myName]
# if we put the designated assigned variable within parenthesis, after running the commnad, the code will also be visible apart from the results
# "alt" + "-" key will help us put " <- " automatically
# the funtion whose value you want to store should be placed on the right and you don't need to put double codes if you are using a function
# help("insert the function") # why ther command is not working, we will check the documentation 
# we can replace the "help" fucntion with "?"
# "{}" this tells us the name of the package in which the function is present
