# R project - Happinness scores analysis  
# Group: Rashi
# The dataset I retrieved from "Kaggle" is analyzed to determine the relationship between Happiness Index Score in 2018 and a number of 
# independent variables such as 'Overall rank', 'GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices', 
# 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'. 
# The dataset is composed of Happiness Index scores of 156 countries 
# along with information regarding Their per capita GDP which represents the economic well-being of citizens, 
# The social support quantifies the degree to which people have access to social networks including family and friends,
# The healthy life expectancy measures how long people may expect to live in excellent health
# The freedom to make decisions in life demonstrates how much control and autonomy people have over their lives,
# and finally, The perception of corruption helps us to understand how prevalent it is in that society.

# Overall rank: the number of total country observed
  # Quantitative - numeric
