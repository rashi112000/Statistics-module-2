# R project - Happinness scores analysis  
# Group: Rashi
# The dataset I retrieved from "Kaggle" is analyzed to determine the relationship between Happiness Index Score in 2018 and a number of 
# independent variables such as 'Overall rank', 'GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices', 
# 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'. 
# The dataset is composed of Happiness Index scores of 156 countries 
# along with information regarding Their per capita GDP which represents the economic well-being of citizens, 
# The social support quantifies the degree to which people have access to social networks including family and friends,
# The healthy life expectancy measures how long people may expect to live in excellent health
# The freedom to make decisions in life demonstrates how much control and autonomy people have over their lives,
# and finally, The perception of corruption helps us to understand how prevalent it is in that society. 

# The information included in the dataset includes the following variables:
# Overall rank: the number of total country observed
  # Quantitative - numeric
  # Original Variable Name: Overall rank
  # Modified Variable Name: column removed
# Country or region: The countries whose above mentioned varaibles are calculated
  # Qualitative - character
  # Original Variable Name: Country or region
  # Modified Variable Name: main_country
# Happiness score :The score of each country
  # Qualitative - numeric/double
  # Original Variable Name: Score
  # Modified Variable Name: Happiness_score
# GDP per capita: Gross Domestic Product per capita for every country
  # Qualitative - numeric/double
  # Original Variable Name: GDP per capita
  # Modified Variable Name: GDP
# Social support

  # Original Variable Name: GDP per capita
  # Modified Variable Name: GDP
# Healthy life expectancy

# The following goals will be accomplished using this dataset:
# 1. What is the absolute frequency distribution of the observations in regards 
#    to endangered status
# 2. What is the distribution of observations within each subspecies in the data set
# 3. What is the average claw size for each main species and which of the 
#    two main species have the longer claws on average
# 4. How does the distribution of the weight and total length of each subspecies
#    compare with each other for each of the two main species
# 5. Is there a relationship between the weight & total
#    length variables for either of the two main species
