# R project - Happinness scores analysis
# Group: Parimal Maurya, Rashi Singh, Fausto

# The dataset I retrieved from "Kaggle" is analyzed to determine the relationship between Happiness Index Score in 2018 and a number of
# independent variables such as 'Overall rank', 'GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices',
# 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'.
# The dataset is composed of Happiness Index scores of 156 countries
# along with information regarding Their per capita GDP which represents the economic well-being of citizens,
# The social support quantifies the degree to which people have access to social networks including family and friends,
# The healthy life expectancy measures how long people may expect to live in excellent health
# The freedom to make decisions in life demonstrates how much control and autonomy people have over their lives,
# and finally, The perception of corruption helps us to understand how prevalent it is in that society.

# The information included in the dataset includes the following variables:
# Overall rank: the number of total countries observed
# Quantitative - numeric
# Original Variable Name: Overall rank
# Modified Variable Name: -
# Country or region: The countries whose above mentioned varaibles are calculated
# Qualitative - character
# Original Variable Name: Country or region
# Modified Variable Name: Country
# Happiness score :The score of each country
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: Score
# Modified Variable Name: -
# GDP per capita: Gross Domestic Product per capita for every country
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: GDP per capita
# Modified Variable Name: -
# Social support
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: Social support
# Modified Variable Name: column removed
# Healthy life expectancy
# Qualitative - numeric/double
# Original Variable Name: Healthy life expectancy
# Modified Variable Name: Life expectancy
# Freedom to make life choices
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: Freedom to make life choices
# Modified Variable Name: Freedom
# Perceptions of corruption
# Qualitative - double
# Original Variable Name: Perceptions of corruption

# Applying more functions to have an idea of the variables type and number of observations observations

# Another way to summarize the dataset is the str function
str(year_2018)
# This again shows the # of columns, # of rows,
# variable names and associated data types in a different format

# To look at the table version of the dataset with the tibble function
tibble(year_2018)
# This shows the dataset in a table format, with a view of the first 10
# observations

# We want to focus our analysis on a subdataset of the initial, so we have extracted parameters we were interested in using following code
year2018sub <- year_2018[ ,c("Country.or.region", "GDP.per.capita", "Healthy.life.expectancy", "Freedom.to.make.life.choices")]

# Renaming some parameters to make our study easy
year2018sub <- rename(year2018sub, Life_expectancy = Healthy.life.expectancy, Freedom = Freedom.to.make.life.choices)
year2018sub

# Using summary function to have an idea of lower, highest, and central tendency
summary(year2018sub)

# We can create a new column in the year_2018sub dataframe called "Development" that categorizes countries based on their GDP per capita.
# First, we need to determine the cutoffs for each category
developed_cutoff <- quantile(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, 0.75)

# Now we can use the ifelse() function to assign each country to a category based on their GDP per capita.
year2018sub$Development <- ifelse(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita >= developed_cutoff, "Developed", ifelse(year_2018$GDP.per.capita >= developing_cutoff, "Developing", "Underdeveloped"))

# We use a barplot to represent it graphically
barplot(table(year2018sub$Development), main = "Categories based on per capita GDP")
# The figure shows that the number of developed and developing nations is identical while the number of underdeveloped nations is approximately twice as large. 

# We can also use grouped boxplot to show different categories

# and another one, more focused on relation between GDP and Development
year2018sub %>%

# Now we analyzed relation between life expectancy and development category
year2018sub %>%

# As can be seen, the life expectancy is higher in developed nations and decreases as we move into the category of developing and undeveloped nations.  

# Let's plot life expectancy with GDP
# We can use the ggplot2 library to create a scatterplot comparing GDP per capita with healthy life expectancy.
# Then, we can create the scatterplot using the aes() function to specify the x and y variables.
ggplot(year2018sub, aes(x = GDP.per.capita, y = Life_expectancy)) +
geom_point() +
labs(title = "GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy",
x = "GDP per Capita",
y = "Healthy Life Expectancy")

# The correlation between the two is evident since life expectancy rises in tandem with rising GDP per capita. 

# We do the same to understand graphically the trend of GDP and Freedom
ggplot(year2018sub, aes(x = GDP.per.capita, y = Freedom )) +
geom_point() +
labs(title = "GDP per Capita vs. Freedom",

# Since there isn't a clear link between the variables in the earlier graph

# we decided to verify it using pearson correlation test
cor.test(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, year2018sub$Freedom)
# This effectively shows low level of correlation (0.33)

# then we applyied the same test to GDP and Life expectancy
cor.test(year2018sub$GDP.per.capita, year2018sub$Life_expectancy)
# This effectively shows high level of correlation (0.84)

# Now let us look at relationship between GDP and Happiness Index
GDPandHAPPINESS <- cbind(year2018sub, year_2018$Score)

# The plot shows a negative relationship between the two, with Happiness ratings falling as GDP rises. 


# Analysing the relation between Development category and Happiness Score
COUNTRYandSCORE <- GDPandHAPPINESS[ , c(5, 6)]

# We can clearly see that Underdeveloped nations have higher happiness score as compared to the countries who are developed.

# Hypothesis Testing

# Hypothesis Test: GDP per Capita & Happiness Score
# H0: there is no correlation between the GDP per Capita and Happiness Score
# H1: there is a strong correlation: GDP per Capita ~ Happiness Score

# We applied a linear model testing to test our hypothesis
GDPandHAPPINESS3 %>%
lm(GDP.per.capita ~ `year_2018$Score`, data = .) %>% summary()

# The test returned a very small p-value (2e-16) and a R-squared of 0.64 indicating strong correlation between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score
# Therefore, H0, the null hypothesis can be rejected

# The result of this hypothesis test is supported by the scatter plot above between GDP per Capita & Happiness Score which shows a negative correlation between the two variables
